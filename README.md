# Quarterback-Rating-Calc
# Purpose
This program calculates the Quarterback Rating (QR) of a quarterback based on their performance in a football game. The program takes in the number of passes completed, the number of passes attempted, the number of gross yards passing, the number of touchdowns thrown, and the number of interceptions thrown as inputs. 
# Formula
QR = 100 * (((COM/ATT * 100 - 30)/20) + ((YD/ATT - 3)/4) + ((TD/ATT * 100)/5) + ((1/4) * (9.5 - (INT/ATT) * 100))) / 6

Here COM is the number of passes completed, ATT is the number of passes attempted, YD is the number of gross yards passing, TD is the number of touchdowns thrown, and INT is the number of interceptions thrown.
# Installation
To run the program, simply open the Python file in your preferred text editor or IDE and run the script.
